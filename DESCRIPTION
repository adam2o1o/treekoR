Description: treekoR is a novel framework that aims to utilise the hierarchical 
    nature of single cell cytometry data to find robust and interpretable associations 
    between cell subsets and patient clinical end points. These associations are aimed to 
    recapitulate the nested proportions prevalent in workflows inovlving manual gating, 
    which are often overlooked in workflows using automatic
    clustering to identify cell populations. We developed treekoR to:
    Derive a hierarchical tree structure of cell clusters; quantify a cell types as 
    a proportion relative to all cells in a sample (%total), and, as 
    the proportion relative to a parent population (%parent); perform significance 
    testing using the calculated proportions; and provide an 
    interactive html visualisation to help highlight key results.
